    <h2>Tara's background:</h2>
      <p>Tara Kelly was born on August 4, 1988. She grew up in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Square,_New_York" target="_blank">Franklin Square, NY</a>, a town in Nassau County, Long Island.<br>
      As a child, Tara took interest in sports, music & film. She spent her days playing soccer & softball, but also found the time to learn electric guitar.<br>
      Tara was also fond of computers & video games. She'd spend hours of her days on her computer playing games, and also trying to learn how to customize them to her liking.<br>
      Her affinity for computers carried into college, where her friends would often ask her to troubleshoot any minor technical issues they'd face with their laptops.<br>
      It also helped her with her studies in finance, as she was required to frequently use the function features provided in <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel" target = "_blank">Microsoft Excel.</a><br>
      After college, Tara decided to follow in her father's footsteps and pursue a career in the film industry. She was inducted into the <a href = "https://www.iatselocal52.org/" target="_blank">Local 52 International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees</a>,<br>
